# Room-wise AI Automated Scheduler

## 🔧 Tech Stack

This project is built using a modern, full-stack toolchain:

### Frontend

- **Vite** – Lightning-fast dev server and build tool  
- **React** – For creating dynamic and interactive UIs  
- **TypeScript** – For type-safe, maintainable frontend code  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for fast styling  
- **shadcn/ui** – Accessible and beautifully styled UI components

### Backend & AI Scheduling Engine

- **Python** – Core logic and algorithm implementation  
- **FastAPI** – High-performance web framework for building RESTful APIs  
- **Genetic Algorithm** – Used to optimize timetable generation by simulating evolutionary processes  
- **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** – Ensures conflict-free schedules based on faculty availability, room constraints, and breaks

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Room-wise AI-Powered Automated Scheduler** is designed to automatically generate optimized class schedules based on:

- 🧑‍🏫 **Faculty Availability**  
- 🏫 **Room and Subject Mapping**  
- ⏰ **Institution-defined Breaks**  
- 📆 **Multi-room, multi-slot scheduling with conflict resolution**

The system combines **real-time availability data** with **AI optimization techniques** to create efficient, conflict-free schedules. It intelligently balances workload and constraints using Genetic Algorithms and CSP techniques to ensure feasible and optimized timetable allocation for every room.
